# PracSOLID3WithCDI3DE
My practice of SOLID3 library with the book "Collision Detection In Interactive 3D Environments".



I'm planning to rewrite all of codes in SOLID3 software library, in order to study collision detection.

But, I will replace the prefix 'MT' on SOLID3 with my prefix 'CH'. I don't know the reason, but i just want to do that.
